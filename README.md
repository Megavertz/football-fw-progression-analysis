    "# Football Data Analysis: Progressive Actions per 90 Minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the performance of football players is analyzed with a focus on progressive carries and passes per 90 minutes for forwards. Data has been scraped from [FBref](https://fbref.com), stored in a PostgreSQL database, and visualized using Python with Matplotlib and Seaborn.\n",

    "- **Progressive Passes per 90 minutes**\n",

    "1. The repository should be cloned:\n",
    "\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/yourusername/football-data-analysis.git\n",
    "cd football-data-analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Dependencies should be installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A .env file should be created and filled with database credentials.\n",
